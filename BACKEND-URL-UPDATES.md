# Backend URL Updates

## Overview
This document outlines all the changes made to update the backend URL from localhost to the production URL (`https://travel-app-backend-tw9n.onrender.com`) throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Environment File (.env)
Updated the API URL configuration in the frontend `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://travel-app-backend-tw9n.onrender.com/api
```

### 2. Package.json Proxy Setting
Updated the proxy setting in `frontend/package.json` to use the production backend URL:

```json
"proxy": "https://travel-app-backend-tw9n.onrender.com"
```

### 3. API Service Fallback URL
Updated the fallback URL in `frontend/src/services/api.js` to use the production backend URL:

```javascript
baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://travel-app-backend-tw9n.onrender.com/api',
```

## Verification
After making these changes, you should rebuild and redeploy the frontend application. Please refer to the [Frontend Redeployment Guide](./FRONTEND-REDEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Errors**
   - Ensure that the backend URL includes the `/api` prefix for all API requests
   - Verify that the backend server is running and accessible

2. **CORS Issues**
   - Check that the backend CORS configuration includes the frontend domain
   - Refer to [CORS-CONFIGURATION.md](./CORS-CONFIGURATION.md) for more details

3. **Environment Variables Not Applied**
   - Make sure to rebuild the frontend application after updating environment variables
   - In development, restart the development server after changing environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Test all API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly with the new backend URL
2. Monitor application performance and error logs
3. Update documentation to reflect the new backend URL
